**HTML (HyperText Markup Language):**

HTML is like the backbone of a website. It stands for HyperText Markup Language. Think of it as the structure and content of a web page. It uses a system of tags (enclosed in angle brackets, like `<tag>`) to define elements on a web page. These elements can include headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML tells your web browser what each part of the web page is and how it should be displayed. It's like the blueprint for a website.

For example, here's a simple HTML code snippet that creates a basic webpage structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text on my webpage.</p>
  <img src="myimage.jpg" alt="A beautiful image">
  <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
</body>
</html>
```
