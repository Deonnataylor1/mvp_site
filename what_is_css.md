**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):**

CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is all about making your website look good. While HTML defines the structure and content, CSS defines the presentation and style. You can think of it as the design and layout of a webpage. With CSS, you can change the colors, fonts, positioning, and more to make your site visually appealing.

Here's a simple example of CSS code that changes the color of the heading from the HTML example above:

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
```

By linking this CSS to your HTML, it will make the `<h1>` text blue.
